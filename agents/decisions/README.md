# Decision records

This directory contains dewasm's decision records.
Each document captures a significant design decision: its context, the decision with its rationale, the rejected alternatives, and the consequences.
An entry is numbered: `<N>-<slug>.md`, cited as "decision N".

## How to read

- **Decision 0** is the foundation document: start there for the project's goal, scope, and architecture.
- Higher-numbered decisions build on it and can be read as needed.
- Each decision opens with a **Status** paragraph: the status label, a date, and a one-paragraph "what landed / what remains" summary.
- The status label is exactly one of two values: `Accepted`, or `Superseded (decision N)` naming what replaced it.
  The parenthetical is required on `Superseded`; a record that does not name its successor leaves the reader with nowhere to go.
- There is no `Proposed`: a decision is recorded once it is made, and a tentative idea lives in an issue until then.
- Scope and progress qualifiers never go in the label.
  That a decision covers one backend only, or that part of it has since been replaced, belongs in the Status paragraph, which has room to say what and why.

## Adding a new decision

### Does the decision need one?

An entry records a decision with rationale and rejected alternatives, or a standing policy.
If no alternatives were weighed, there is nothing to record:

- A mechanical change with no live alternatives → the commit message is enough.
- Behavior the spec harness already enforces → the harness binds (decision 3), and a decision records *why*, never a normative description the harness already carries.
- A survey or a measurement with no decision attached → leave it in the issue or the pull request; when the outcome changes what a future agent would do, add an entry to [`agents/experiments.md`](../experiments.md).

### Procedure

1. Take the next free number: `ls agents/decisions/` gives the highest `N`, and yours is `N + 1`, with no zero padding.
   Create `agents/decisions/<N>-<slug>.md`.
2. Follow the skeleton:

   ```markdown
   # Decision N: <title>

   Status: **Accepted, <YYYY-MM-DD>.** <one paragraph: what landed / what remains.>

   ## Context
   ## Decision              <- the discriminating criterion, as a reusable rule
   ## Rejected alternatives <- each with the reason it lost
   ## Consequences          <- positive / negative / carry-over
   ```

3. Add a row to the index above, in ascending order, carrying the same status label as the file.
4. Cross-reference: link related decisions, and link from the decision out to the code and docs it governs.
   Files outside `agents/` never cite a decision; they state their constraint in place.
   If the decision changes how contributors must work, add or adjust the one-line rule in `AGENTS.md` citing the decision: the rule there, the why here, never both in full.
5. If it supersedes an earlier decision, set that one's label to `Superseded (decision N)` in both the file and the index, and link forward from its Status paragraph.

Then verify:

- The index row count matches the file count: `ls agents/decisions/*.md | grep -v README | wc -l` against the table.
- Every relative link in the new decision resolves.

### Quality bar

- State the *criterion* that discriminated between the options as a reusable rule, not just "we picked B".
- **Length tracks stakes.**
  The common failure mode is writing too much, not too little.
  Decision 5 is a reasonable length for a policy-sized decision, decision 0 for a foundation-sized one.
- Move research material (surveys, comparison tables) out of the record and cite it; the record is the decision, not the research.
- Anchor claims to real code (`crates/.../file.rs`, `crates/dewasm-backend-<lang>/units/`) where possible.

## Relationship to other documents

- **`AGENTS.md`**: the development contract for agents (and humans) working in this repository; it states each rule in full and cites the decision that holds the rationale.
- **`agents/docs-policy.md`**: the document taxonomy, which file each kind of content belongs in, why `agents/` and `docs/` are split by audience, and why `docs/support.md` is generated, never hand-edited.
- **`README.md`**: user-facing overview.
  It points onward to `docs/getting-started.md`, `docs/backends/`, and `docs/support.md`, not into this directory.
- **`docs/getting-started.md`** and **`docs/backends/`**: the user tutorial and per-target reference.
  They state the lowering rules in place and name no decision; the rationale behind those rules lives here (decision 4, decisions 11 to 13, decisions 28 to 30, decision 55).
