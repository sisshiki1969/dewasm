# Decision 59: NES Demo (A Self-Built Guest with a File-Based ROM and an Export-Only Interface)

Status: **Accepted, 2026-08-04.**
`examples/nes` runs a NES emulator converted with `--mode library` on all six backends, in the DOOM demo's shape ([decision 50](50-doom-example-shape.md)): one wasm artifact, per-language native frontends, a deterministic framebuffer snapshot ([decision 53](53-doom-frame-snapshot.md)/[decision 56](56-unified-snapshot-regeneration.md)).
Unlike DOOM there is no suitable upstream binary, so `examples/apps/scripts/nes.sh` builds `nes.wasm` from a pinned emulation library plus a thin wrapper checked in at `examples/apps/src/nes_demo.c`.
Amended 2026-08-04: the frame is handed over as agnes's own palette-index buffer plus its palette (`screenOffset`/`paletteOffset`) instead of a BGRA image rendered in-guest, which cost 12-15% of frame time on every backend and told the host nothing it could not compose itself (issue #117); the composed pixels are identical, so the pinned snapshot is unchanged.
Extended with `ruby/gui/`, a windowed Ruby frontend on gosu sharing the terminal frontend's generated library; the second-frontend rationale and the bundler scoping are recorded with the DOOM example's counterpart in [decision 50](50-doom-example-shape.md).

## Context

The DOOM example demonstrates library mode's *import* surface: the host implements ten functions.
Its criterion (the wasm module is the portable artifact, the host side is the only porting seam) is worth reusing, but DOOM bakes its game data (the shareware WAD) into the guest, so the demo runs exactly one program.
A console emulator is the natural next specimen: the guest is a fixed machine and the program is data (a ROM file), so one artifact can run anything the emulator's mapper coverage admits.
No upstream ships a NES emulator as a plain wasm32 binary with an embeddable interface; the existing wasm ports are Emscripten/wasm-bindgen builds whose import surfaces are JS glue, which dewasm deliberately does not target.

## Decision

Build the guest ourselves from [agnes](https://github.com/kgabis/agnes) (single-pair C NES emulation library, MIT, no dependencies, mappers NROM/UxROM/MMC1/MMC3, no APU), pinned per-file by sha256 like every locally-built app ([decision 22](22-sqlite3-built-from-source.md), [decision 39](39-wasm-opt-preprocessing.md)).
Two interface decisions, each the discriminating criterion for future emulator-style demos:

- **The ROM is a separate file, loaded by the host.**
  The frontend reads the `.nes` file and copies it into guest memory through `allocRom(size) -> ptr`; the guest never sees a filesystem.
  Criterion: *data the demo exists to swap stays outside the artifact; data the demo never varies (DOOM's WAD) may stay inside.*
  The demo ROM is [Alter Ego](https://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=7999) by Shiru (public domain, mapper 0), fetched checksum-pinned; any ROM within agnes's mappers works via the frontends' optional path argument.
- **The interface is export-only: the import section is empty** (`nes.sh` fails the build if an import appears).
  Exports: `allocRom`, `initGame`, `setInput`, `tickGame`, `screenOffset`/`paletteOffset`/`frameWidth`/`frameHeight`, `memory`.
  Where DOOM needed a host clock import to terminate its internal waits, a NES frame is a fixed unit of work (1/60 s of console time), so pacing belongs wholly to the host and the guest needs nothing from it.
  Criterion: *an import earns its place only when the guest cannot progress without the host's answer; pacing, input polling, and presentation never qualify.*
  The frame crosses the boundary in the emulator's own representation, one palette index per pixel (masked with `0x3f`) plus the fixed 64-entry `R,G,B,A` palette, and the host composes the pixels: rendering is presentation, and a per-pixel loop is far cheaper in the host language than in decompiled wasm.
  `nes_demo.c` `#include`s `agnes.c` to reach those internals, so no upstream patch is needed.
  Criterion: *hand over the guest's own representation; convert only in the host* (`crates/dewasm-test-helper/src/nes.rs` carries the shared encoder).

The snapshot is captured after 40 input-free frames, the smallest count safely inside the first stable screen (the credits fade-in completes at ~37; every extra frame is real wall time in Bash's ultra-slow category).
The degenerate-frame guard accepts ≥5 distinct colors: NES palettes are small (the pinned frame has 7), so DOOM's >50 threshold does not transfer (`crates/xtask/src/nes_snapshot.rs`).

## Rejected alternatives

- **Embedding the ROM at build time (DOOM's shape).**
  Makes `nes.wasm` single-program and forces a rebuild per ROM, discarding the emulator's whole point as a demo; also couples the artifact pin to the ROM pin.
- **Guest-side ROM loading via WASI.**
  Natural in C but pushes preopen/argv wiring into all six frontends and the snapshot oracle, surrendering the empty import section for no demonstrative gain: WASI file I/O is already exercised by CPython, CRuby, and sqlite3.
- **Other emulator cores.**
  binjnes (more accurate, more mappers) is entangled with its Emscripten/SDL host layers; smolnes is code-golfed beyond modification; the Rust cores target wasm-bindgen.
  Criterion as above: the core must compile to wasm32 with no host assumptions we don't control.

## Consequences

- Positive: first demo where the converted artifact is a *platform* rather than a program: the frontends are six native NES players.
  The export-only interface is the simplest possible library-mode embedding, a gentler reference than DOOM's imports.
- Negative: agnes has no APU (silent, like DOOM) and its mapper coverage caps which ROMs run; accuracy is hobby-grade, accepted because the demo claims conversion fidelity (byte-identical frames across backends), not emulation fidelity.
- Carry-over: `setInput` is untested by the snapshot (input-free by design); the frontends are its only exercise.
