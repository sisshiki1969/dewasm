# Decision 53: Test DOOM by a Deterministic Framebuffer Snapshot

Status: **Accepted, 2026-07-31.**
Extends the DOOM demo (decision 50) into the test test: drive the converted `doom.wasm` with a self-advancing synthetic clock and a fixed, input-free tick count, then compare the raw framebuffer it renders, pixel for pixel, against a snapshot captured once from a wasmtime oracle.
Implemented: the oracle (`cargo xtask update-doom-snapshot`), the shared contract and runners (`crates/dewasm-test-helper/src/doom.rs`), the committed snapshot (`examples/doom/snapshot/frame.ppm`), and the frame case on Ruby/Python/Go/Java plus the frame case on all five backends (byte-identical).
Bash runs at the ultra_slow_test category, the others at slow.

## Context

`examples/doom` converts the unmodified [jacobenget/doom.wasm](https://github.com/jacobenget/doom.wasm) v0.1.0 to every backend and runs it behind per-language frontends (decision 50), but nothing in `cargo test` exercises it.
DOOM is the largest real module we convert and the only one driven purely through **custom host imports** (ten functions across `console`/`gameSaving`/`runtimeControl`/`ui`/`loading`) with **no WASI surface at all**, a coverage shape none of the `apps`/`apps_capi` cases reach.
A regression that only this module would surface (a data-segment, `call_indirect`-table, or accumulated-arithmetic bug in a 640×400 software renderer) currently ships unnoticed.

Two facts make a snapshot possible where the module first looks untestable:

- **The framebuffer is a deterministic function of the tick schedule.**
  DOOM's software renderer is fixed-point integer (no floats), so the pixels are pure integer computation, identical across wasmtime and every backend regardless of the softfloat/NaN conventions (decision 2/13).
  The only nondeterminism is the game clock: `runtimeControl.timeInMilliseconds` paces the tic loop, and all five frontends feed it a *wall* clock (`examples/doom/go/doom/host.go:100-105`, `examples/doom/ruby/main.rb:73`).
  Override that import with a synthetic counter that self-advances a fixed step on every read and drive `initGame` then N× `tickGame` with no key events, and the rendered frame is reproducible.
- **`ui.drawFrame(bufOff)` hands the host an offset into linear memory** where `FRAME_W*FRAME_H*4` bytes live in `B,G,R,A` order, the alpha byte padding (`examples/doom/go/doom/host.go:107-122`).
  For this pinned binary FRAME is 640×400, so the frame is 1,024,000 bytes; dropping the don't-care alpha yields a 640×400 RGB image, a P6 PPM, the exact format the frontends' own screenshot writers already emit (`examples/doom/ruby/main.rb:339-354`).

The existing snapshot machinery does not stretch to cover this: the wasmtime ground truth runs through the **`wasmtime` CLI** (`crates/dewasm-test-helper/src/wasmtime_backend.rs:61`), and `wasmtime run` cannot supply DOOM's custom imports.
Producing the oracle frame needs a real embedder, not the CLI.

## Decision

Add a **deterministic framebuffer snapshot** test, structured like the C-API cases (`crates/dewasm-test-helper/src/apps_capi.rs`): convert `doom.wasm` in library mode, append per-backend glue, compare output.
Three specifics:

- **Driving contract (identical in the oracle and every backend).**
  Provide the imports; `timeInMilliseconds` is a counter that self-advances a *large* fixed step (1000 ms) on every read.
  Self-advancing (not frozen between host steps) is what stops it hanging (DOOM's startup and inter-tic waits spin on the clock, so it must keep moving), and the read count, hence the exact clock sequence, is a pure function of the wasm, identical across the oracle and every backend.
  The step is *large* so DOOM's spiral-of-death protection caps the tics it simulates (a big jump makes it skip ahead, exactly as the real wall clock does when it leaps between a slow backend's calls); a 1 ms step would creep to seconds of simulated time and make DOOM run ~80 tics, byte-identical but tens of times more work, turning the Bash run into ~an hour.
  `wadSizes`/`readWads` are no-ops (the module falls back to its embedded shareware WAD when the out-params stay zero, `examples/doom/go/doom/host.go:124-133`), `gameSaving.*` are `0/0/len` no-ops (no filesystem, as bash already proves at `examples/doom/bash/main.sh:89-96`).
  Call `initGame`, then N× `tickGame` with no input, and dump the last `drawFrame` buffer as a 640×400 P6 PPM (alpha dropped).
  N is fixed and pinned by the snapshot: the smallest count that clears the demo intro to a stable, non-degenerate frame.
- **Oracle = the wasmtime crate, in a snapshot generator, not the test path.**
  A small Rust host embeds `wasmtime`, runs the *original* `doom.wasm` under the driving contract above, and writes `examples/doom/snapshot/frame.ppm`, refreshed on demand via `cargo xtask update-doom-snapshot` (mirroring `update-repl-snapshot`).
  The committed PPM is the oracle the per-backend tests compare against; the heavy `wasmtime` crate is an **xtask/tooling dependency only**, never pulled into the normal `cargo test` build.
- **Fetch as a shared fixture.**
  `doom.wasm` moves into the apps cache via a new `examples/apps/scripts/doom.sh` (checksum-pinned through `fetch_app`), replacing the unchecksummed `examples/doom/fetch.sh`; the demo build scripts read it from `examples/apps/cache/` like the harness does.

**Discriminating criterion:** *a module driven by custom host imports is still snapshot-testable whenever its output is a deterministic function of an injectable clock: pin the clock, fix the inputs, and diff the rendered artifact.*
The oracle is an independent embedder (wasmtime), not backend consensus, because the value of the test is catching a bug the backends could share.

**Speed assignment.**
The frame-snapshot test runs on every backend, classified to match each backend's convention for a comparably heavy execution case.
Ruby/Python/Go/Java use **slow_test** (CI's main run, like the qjs/sqlite e2e), so DOOM is actually exercised in CI.
Bash uses **ultra_slow_test** (decision 48), like its qjs-REPL pty case: its run is minutes (initGame ~2 min + ticks + serializing a 1 MB framebuffer out of the associative-array memory), so it stays out of CI and runs only in local pre-release.
There is no separate conversion smoke: the frame test already exercises the full convert-and-run path, and a convert-only assertion would be an idiom no other suite uses.
*(Amended by [decision 54](54-apps-convert-suite.md): the convert-only assertion is now the idiom of a whole-cache per-backend convert suite, which includes a fast `doom` convert trial on every backend.
The frame-snapshot run above stays the convert-and-run test; the two are complementary.)*

## Rejected alternatives

- **Backend-consensus snapshot (no external oracle).**
  Cheaper (no `wasmtime` crate), but it only proves the backends *agree*, so a bug in the shared converter or the shared numeric conventions (decision 2) passes.
  An independent embedder is the whole point of a snapshot; rejected.
- **Sanity-only check (reuse the frontends' `--smoke`).**
  The frontends already assert "enough distinct colors / has glyphs" (`examples/doom/bash/main.sh:400-417`), which is cheap but catches only gross breakage and is non-deterministic (wall clock).
  It stays as the demo's self-check; it is not the test.
- **Oracle via the `wasmtime` CLI, like the apps snapshots.**
  `wasmtime run` cannot provide DOOM's custom imports (`crates/dewasm-test-helper/src/wasmtime_backend.rs`); unusable here.
- **Extend the frontends with a snapshot-dump mode instead of dedicated test glue.**
  Avoids duplicating the import wiring, but loads test-only concerns (synthetic clock, raw dump) into five demo programs and couples the test to the demo.
  Dedicated glue consts (the `apps_capi` precedent) keep the two separate; the wiring duplication is accepted.

## Consequences

- Positive: the converter gains regression coverage on its largest, most import-heavy real module, pinned to a pixel-exact frame an independent runtime produced, the strongest oracle available for it.
- Positive: `doom.wasm` becomes a checksum-pinned fixture like every other app (closing the decision 9 gap the old `examples/doom/fetch.sh` left open).
- Negative: a new heavy `wasmtime`-crate dependency, quarantined to xtask; the snapshot must be regenerated (and reviewed) whenever the `doom.wasm` pin bumps.
- Negative / carry-over: the frame test runs in CI for four backends but Bash's is ultra_slow (local pre-release only).
  The synthetic-clock tick count N is a magic constant the snapshot pins, documented at the glue, not derived.
