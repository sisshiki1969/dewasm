# NES on dewasm

One NES, six languages: [agnes](https://github.com/kgabis/agnes) (a dependency-free C NES emulation library, MIT) plus a thin wrapper ([`../apps/src/nes_demo.c`](../apps/src/nes_demo.c)) compiled to a single 19KB wasm module with an **empty import section**, converted by `dewasm --mode library` and played through seven native frontends across six languages:

- [`go/`](go/): Go, rendering with [ebiten](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten)
- [`java/`](java/): Java, rendering with Swing (plain JDK, zero dependencies)
- [`ruby/`](ruby/): Ruby, rendering *into the terminal* as 24-bit-color ANSI half-blocks (stdlib only, run with `--yjit`)
- [`ruby/gui/`](ruby/gui/): the same generated Ruby library in a window, with [gosu](https://www.libgosu.org/), in the shape of the DOOM demo's [`ruby/gui`](../doom/ruby/gui); real key releases feed `setInput`'s held-button bitmask directly
- [`python/`](python/): Python, the same terminal renderer (stdlib only, ~11 frames/sec under PyPy, ~2.2 under CPython)
- [`perl/`](perl/): Perl, the same terminal renderer (core modules only, ~0.9 frames/sec)
- [`bash/`](bash/): pure Bash, same terminal renderer; ~20-40 seconds per frame, an existence proof in the bash-DOOM tradition

See each subdirectory's README for exact numbers and rendering details.
The wasm module is the portable artifact and (unlike DOOM, whose WAD is baked in) the program it runs is your choice: pass any ROM within agnes's mapper coverage (NROM/UxROM/MMC1/MMC3) as an argument.

![The deterministic NES frame snapshot](../apps/snapshots/nes_frame.png)

*The frame the framebuffer-snapshot test pins: 40 input-free frames into [Alter Ego](https://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=7999) (the bundled demo ROM, a puzzle platformer by Shiru, public domain), every backend and the wasmtime oracle render these exact pixels, so it doubles as a cross-backend conformance snapshot in the DOOM snapshot's harness.
The compared oracle is `nes_frame.ppm`; this PNG is the same frame for human eyes.*

## Run

```sh
go/run.sh    # or: java/run.sh, ruby/run.sh, ruby/gui/run.sh, ...
go/run.sh path/to/other.nes   # any ROM agnes's mappers cover
```

`build.sh` fetches agnes and the Alter Ego ROM (checksum-pinned) and compiles `nes.wasm` with `zig cc` (via `../apps/scripts/nes.sh`) into the gitignored apps cache.
Each frontend also has a headless `-smoke`/`--smoke` mode that ticks the emulator without a window/tty, sanity-checks the rendered frame, and writes it to a screenshot file.

Controls (all frontends): arrows = D-pad, `x` = A, `z` = B, Enter = Start, Space = Select, `q`/Esc = quit.

No sound: agnes has no APU.
The frontends are built by their own scripts and are not part of `cargo test`; the frame snapshot above is, with the DOOM case's speed assignment (slow, Bash at ultra).
