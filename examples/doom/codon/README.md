# DOOM (Codon, ANSI terminal)

An interactive frontend for the DOOM shareware episode that renders straight into the terminal: no window, no GPU.
`build.sh` fetches jacobenget/doom.wasm (checksum-pinned into the shared apps cache), converts it to Codon with dewasm (`doom_gen.codon`, ~10MB, gitignored, regenerated on every build), and compiles that together with the host program in `main.codon` into one native binary.
`main.codon` implements the module's host imports (console messages, save-game files, the game clock, frame delivery, and thirteen audio imports it answers silently), draws the framebuffer as 24-bit-color half-blocks, and reads keys from the terminal in raw mode.

This is the [Python frontend](../python/) compiled ahead of time instead of interpreted.
[Codon](https://github.com/exaloop/codon) is a statically typed Python dialect, not CPython, and its standard library has no `termios`, `select`, `tty` or `os.get_terminal_size`.
The terminal is driven through libc instead: `poll` for non-blocking key reads, `tcgetattr`/`cfmakeraw`/`tcsetattr` for raw mode, and `ioctl(TIOCGWINSZ)` for the terminal size.
A host import is a `DoomRt.Fn` subclass rather than a closure, for the same reason.
Nothing else is needed: no third-party packages.

Codon also has no import path for a sibling source file, so `build.sh` links the frontend against the generated library by concatenating the two into `doom_app.codon` and compiling that, which is how the backend's own test and benchmark runners build generated code.

## Build time

The concatenated source is about 53,000 lines, nearly all of it generated.
A debug `codon build` of it takes about 26 seconds on an Apple Silicon laptop (8 of them the parse), and produces a 17MB binary.

`build.sh` caches the result: the concatenated source is compared byte for byte against the one the existing binary was built from, and an unchanged source skips the compile entirely.
The default is the cheaper debug build; `CODON_BUILD=release ./build.sh` selects the optimized one, which costs about 4.5 minutes on the same source (almost all of it Codon's IR capture analysis, run once per folding round).

## Run

```sh
./run.sh
```

builds and takes over the terminal (alternate screen, hidden cursor, raw input) until you quit.
On a clean checkout that first line converts the module and compiles the result, about half a minute once dewasm itself is built.
`./run.sh --smoke` instead runs a headless self-check: it inits the game, ticks it 15 times with no terminal takeover, sanity-checks the last frame, writes it to `screenshot.ppm` (binary P6, the same format the cross-backend frame snapshot is pinned in), and exits non-zero on failure.

`codon` 0.20 or newer has to be on `PATH`; `DEWASM_CODON` names it explicitly.
`run.sh` puts the toolchain's `lib/codon` directory on the loader path, which a `codon build` binary needs for Codon's runtime shared libraries.

## Honest performance

**The tick rate is unmeasured.**
The binary builds and plays, but no rate is quoted here because none was taken under a method worth quoting: the `--smoke` self-check times 15 ticks, and how much the game simulates per tick depends on the wall clock it reads, so the same binary reports anywhere from 9 to 66 ticks/sec across consecutive runs.
Nothing about the other frontends' rates transfers: `../python/`'s ~45 ticks/sec under PyPy and `../../nes/codon/`'s ~400 frames/sec are different interpreters on different modules, and extrapolating either to this one would be a guess dressed as a measurement.

What was verified is the frontend's own logic, by compiling `main.codon` against a hand-written stub exposing the same `Doom`/`DoomRt` API surface as the generated library (the same boxed `Extern`/`Val`/`Fn` boundary, the same `KEY_*` globals, the same `B,G,R,A` framebuffer in linear memory) and driving that:

- the smoke path writes a well-formed P6 `screenshot.ppm` from the framebuffer and applies its distinct-color check
- the save-game imports round trip: `writeSaveGame` creates `.savegame/` and returns the length, `sizeOfSaveGame` reports it, `readSaveGame` returns it and the bytes land back in linear memory unchanged, and an absent save id returns 0 from both rather than raising
- key decoding and the edge-triggered hold logic are correct under a pty: arrows, `f`, space, comma, period, Tab, a lone Escape and face-value letters and digits each reach `reportKeyDown` once with the module's own key code, each followed by exactly one `reportKeyUp` after the release window
- both quit paths (`q` and Ctrl-C) exit cleanly, with the alternate screen and cursor visibility restored and nothing emitted after the terminal is handed back

That covers everything this directory owns. It does not cover the generated library, which is what the cross-backend spec and framebuffer-snapshot tests cover instead.

The assembled binary passes the same `--smoke` check against the real generated library: the game inits, ticks, and hands over a 640x400 frame with 240 distinct colors.

## Rendering

Each character cell shows two vertically-stacked pixels via the upper-half-block character `▀`: the foreground color is the top pixel, the background color is the bottom pixel, both set with 24-bit truecolor escapes.
DOOM's 640x400 framebuffer is a 2x upscale of its native 320x200, so pixels are sampled from that logical 320x200 grid and nearest-neighbor-fit to however many columns/rows the terminal actually has (capped at 320 columns, one row reserved for the status line).
Only cells that changed since the previous frame are redrawn, and repeated colors within a redrawn run don't re-emit their escape code.

## Controls

- Arrow keys: move / turn
- `f`: fire (Ctrl isn't something a terminal can deliver as a distinct keypress)
- Space: use / open doors
- Comma / period: strafe left / right
- Tab: automap
- Escape / Enter / Backspace: menus
- Other letters and digits: text entry and prompts (`y` confirms, digits select weapons), taken at face value as lowercase ASCII
- `q` or Ctrl-C: quit

Terminals only report key-down events, never key-up, so a release is synthesized: after a keypress, `reportKeyUp` fires automatically once ~400ms pass without seeing that key again (autorepeat from holding a key down keeps extending the deadline).
Raw mode delivers Ctrl-C as a byte on stdin rather than as a signal, so the quit path is the same one `q` takes.
Terminal state is restored from the exact `tcgetattr` snapshot taken at startup, on every exit path.

Save games are written to `.savegame/` (gitignored) relative to wherever the script runs.
