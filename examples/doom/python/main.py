"""Interactive frontend for the dewasm-generated DOOM library (doom_gen.py,
produced from jacobenget/doom.wasm by build.sh). It wires the wasm module's
host imports to real OS facilities (raw-terminal stdio, save-game files,
a monotonic clock) and renders the framebuffer straight into the terminal as
24-bit-color half-blocks: no window, no GPU, just ANSI escapes.

Run with --smoke for a headless self-check (no terminal takeover): it inits
the game, ticks it 15 times, and writes the last frame to screenshot.ppm.

run.sh runs this under PyPy when it is installed, which JITs doom_gen.py to
roughly 45 ticks/sec, past DOOM's own 35Hz tic rate.
CPython has no JIT and interprets the generated code line by line, so there
it is roughly 1.5 ticks/sec: a proof of life, not a playable game.
See README.md for the honest framing.
