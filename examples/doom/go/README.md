# DOOM (Go, ebiten)

An interactive frontend for the DOOM shareware episode, running as pure Go code.
`build.sh` fetches jacobenget/doom.wasm (checksum-pinned into the shared apps cache) and converts it to Go with dewasm (`doom/doom_gen.go`, ~10MB, gitignored, regenerated on every build) and links it against a small host program in `doom/host.go` that implements the module's host imports (console messages, save-game files, the game clock, frame delivery, and thirteen audio imports it answers silently) and drives the game loop with [ebiten](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten).

dewasm converts a module to a Go *package* named after `--module-name`, so the generated file declares `package doom` and lives in `doom/`; the frontend sits in the same directory because it reads the module's linear memory and exported globals directly, which are unexported.
The command at the repository top level is two lines: import the package, call `doom.Run()`.
An embedder that only calls exports needs none of this: it can import the package from anywhere.

## Run

```sh
./run.sh
```

builds and opens a window.
`./run.sh -smoke` instead runs a headless self-check: it inits the game, ticks it 300 times with no window, sanity-checks the last frame, writes it to `screenshot.png`, and exits non-zero on failure.

The game loop runs at 35 ticks per second (DOOM's own internal tic rate), so every `Update()` call advances exactly one game tic instead of some calls being no-ops (the module paces itself internally off a monotonic clock regardless of how often it's ticked).

## Controls

- Arrow keys: move / turn
- Ctrl: fire
- Space: use / open doors
- Shift: run
- Comma / period: strafe left / right
- Tab: automap
- Escape / Enter / Backspace: menus
- Letters and digits: text entry and prompts (`y` confirms, digits select weapons)

Save games are written to `.savegame/` (gitignored) relative to wherever the binary runs.
